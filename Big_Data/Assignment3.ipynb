    "Some general remarks for handing in exercises:\n",
    "- Each exercise comes with context and code from the exercise-set of which it is a part. It is up to you to recycle the right code. If this notebook can be executed from top to bottom on another computer (given the right libraries are installed and data stored) it makes it easier to give points for exercises that were only partially finished for whatever reason (don't worry about running the code from week 8 in the notebook -- I will run those as scrypts, but do include the code in a code a cell and the output you got on your computer in a text cell.\n",
    "- Make sure to answer each sub-exercise\n",
    "- Commenting amply on your results makes it easier to understand that you were on the right track, even if the answer was wrong"

In terms of distribution, we can see that their is a larger spike of words in the beginning of the graph. This is because of how the BOW was made, as the words were put into the DF on order of appearance, meaning that since a lot of the most used words would appear in the first few character's text as well it will be in the beginning of the dataframe. Overall, a decent chunk of words appear about 2000 times, with a few extending beyond that, and the majority sinking below that."
